Demo CRUD app written in Angular with Typescript (Angular2/4, Typescript 2+). 


Styling is pure CSS with no templates or outside packages - there is a heavy amount of CSS Flexbox. 


While this is a small app it covers the same ground as many larger applications. 


All data is retrieved from an in memory mock data service and relayed to the respective component either as an observable or promise.


Vehicles are created with dynamic creation wizard UI, all vehicles are edited/deleted in a validated and intuitive editing UI screen, and vehicles can be searched, filtered and toggled while being viewed. 


The app is modularized by feature, and makes use of modern JS features like classes, types, enums and constants.
